# image-classification    
        this code is a simple image classification script using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to identify objects or categories in an input image and display the top predictions. This type of code is commonly used in applications like image recognition and classification.
        
#Steps involed

Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries and tools for deep learning, including TensorFlow, Keras, and MobileNetV2.

Load Pre-Trained Model: Load a pre-trained deep learning model called MobileNetV2, which can recognize objects in images.

Define a Classification Function: Create a function called classify_image.This function takes the path to an image as input.

Image Processing: Inside the function, load the image and prepare it for classification.Resize the image to a size that the model expects (224x224 pixels).Convert the image into a format that the model can understand.

Use the Pre-Trained Model: Pass the pre-processed image through the MobileNetV2 model to make predictions.

Decode and Display Predictions: Decode the model's predictions to get human-readable labels and confidence scores.Display the top 5 predictions with their labels and scores.

Example Usage: Provide the path to an image ('city.png') as an example.Call the classify_image function with this image.
